# ADR-0001: Universal Recursive Improvement System MVP

**Date**: 2025-08-20  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Context**: Transition from ingester-specific to universal recursive improvement

## Decision
Implement universal 6-Agent recursive improvement system with:
- Context Detection Engine (UCDE)
- Dynamic Agent Orchestration Matrix (DAOM)  
- Multi-Dimensional Quality Gates (MDQG)

## Consequences
- All platform development work benefits from automated improvement
- SRE SLO + DORA metrics provide objective quality measurement
- Circuit Breaker + Saga patterns ensure system stability
