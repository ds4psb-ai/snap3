      "summary": "This comedic short video personifies the struggles of a typical office worker through an AI-generated hamster character named 'Kim Ham'. The narrative follows Kim Ham's emotional rollercoaster, starting with the false hope of leaving work on time, only to be crushed by a last-minute assignment from his boss. The video humorously depicts the grueling process of working overtime, including fighting fatigue, dealing with a catastrophic computer error that nearly deletes all his progress, and resorting to an energy drink for a final push. The ultimate punchline arrives the next morning when Kim Ham discovers that the boss who assigned the urgent task is on vacation, rendering his all-night effort tragically ironic. The comedy is driven by the stark contrast between the hamster's adorable appearance and its increasingly desperate and profane inner monologue, which resonates deeply with audiences familiar with corporate work culture stress.",

      "audience_reaction": {
        "analysis": "The audience reaction is overwhelmingly positive, driven by a strong sense of psychological relatability. Viewers, particularly those with office experience, see their own frustrations with overtime, unreasonable deadlines, and technical failures mirrored in the hamster's plight. The use of a cute hamster as the protagonist, combined with a high-pitched but surprisingly foul-mouthed inner monologue (e.g., '지랄하지마' - 'Don't f*** with me'), creates a powerful comedic dissonance. This allows viewers to laugh at situations that are normally stressful, providing a cathartic release. The shared experience fosters a sense of community in the comments, where users bond over their similar work-related traumas.",
